# ADS_506_Team-6_Final-Project
For the fulfillment of the ADS_506 Time Series Analysis Final Team Project
This GitHub repository is for the fulfillment of the ADS 506 Time Series Analysis Final Team Project. This project is completed by Team 6 consisting of Roger Qin, Dip Raj Bista, and Jessica Hin. The project uses past time series data for furniture, food, used cars, and pharmaceutical retail sectors to predict customer purchasing trends. This project also observes the trends and seasonality of sales and the effects of the 2008 economic crisis. The deliverables will be R script code, data story presentation, and written report. 
The project consists of the following chapters. They are as follows:

1.	Introduction
2.	Problem Statement
3.	Literature Review
4.	Explanation of Steps / Methodology
5.	Discussions
6.	Conclusion
7.	References

The data was obtained from the Kaggle platform. After preprocessing and data cleaning, the differencing was performed based on the obtained trend and seasonality. Then, we used the various time series algorithms to predict the future values for the retail sales items. The time models used are the Na√Øve model, Holt Winter model, Moving Average model, Linear Regression model, and ARIMA model. The evaluation metric used for this project is RMSE. The selection of these metrics is based on the nature of the data and study. Also, RMSE is widely used and is sensitive to larger errors. After comparing RMSE values, we found that different data sets performed better on different time series models. Since various data had unique trends and seasonality, one particular model was not suitable for all of the data. This can benefit the management while preparing marketing strategies to enhance sales.
